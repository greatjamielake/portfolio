Hello I am Jamie Lake and this is my first time creating a website entirely of my own code. Up until this month I've completely depended upon sites like squarespace or wordpress to choose from templates and then find code to customize those. While I would have wanted something more elaborate I look forward to being able to use my graphic design skills a lot better when I can supplement that with great coding in the backend with javascript. There was so much I wanted to do but just couldn't yet.
